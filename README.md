# Email-Generator (Linked List Implementation)

This is the second assignment I did in my Data Structures class, during my 2nd year in ITU CE. It reads the newStudentsList.txt file as input and keeps them in a linked list. The linked list is implemented by me, as it was the main goal of the homework.

While creating the list, it also generates unique emails for each student and writes them out to the emailList.txt file. Students can be added, updated and removed. Students with the same surnames are kept in a separate linked list inside the main linked list. They can be seen with the Show Surname Node command.
